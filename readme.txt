Logging Will Save Us All.

Two extremely useful files.

These two little guys have enabled troubleshooting and problem resolution with customers over the phone months after project completion.

[AbstractDomainObject]
Uses reflection to implement hashCode(), toString() and equals() in generated subclasses. Great for logging.

[LoggingAspect]
Pointcuts entry/exit log messages including parameter names & values to a specified class hierarchy. Logging is done at the Trace level - it is extremely verbose, extremely slow (when turned on), and extremely useful.
